This project is helping me learn to debug, refactor code and write opitimize CSS.

So far in this challenge I was able to detect or alter in, Line 29 was missing id element for search engine
which was causing for the button function to fail.

Title name was changed to the wedpage's name "Horiseon".

Alt attributes was added to all img tags in case of img not appearing on the page the alt tag will provide text of what the img is for.

hero section background-img was optimized by adding all the styles in one shorthand property so the css code is more organized and short but yet functioning.
